FEATURES

Email / SMS
You and i can attest to the fact that, no everytime that administrator or the owner of a particular business will be available to supervise pwhich item was bought, expired, damage, entered to stock or return by a customer, so in order to vanquish such incident, Email or SMS must be sent to the admin so that he or she will know how the system is being operated.

Text to speech
Text messages can easily be ignored but with such feature, it will always announce to the employee who's opereting the software if any item is about to expire, or has expired etc…. So that he or she will quickly contact the admin so that such item could be removed from the store. Again whenever any item is entered in stock table or a customer buy any item, this feature will announce the state of the item if loaded into stock or bought by a customer with appreciation message to the customer i.e Our value customer, thanks for buying from us, see you next time!

Camera
Image is one of the most important thing the word can never doubt.
Whenever a new employee is employ in the work, we take his or her details which we can't forget photo as one of the details about the employee; in case of any misunderstanding, we can identify who's responsible by image and the same image will be shown on the sales-form when login with correct credentials. Again, when entering items to stock, we enter some details about the item including photo because sometimes people normally say, "i don't remember the name of the drug but if i see it, i can identify it"
